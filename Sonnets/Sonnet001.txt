How like trouble this rubbish presented
bundled yet streamlike behaving yet torn
which is the way, should I treat it with scorn?
Certainly I have not well consented.

Sticky the capsule and packaging sent,
Stuck to the sides of the plastic barrel.
Council me on a save for this quarrel!
So that the receptacle will be went.

This mode of trash travel has wheels so smooth,
And a bin's aim will ease your frustration.
Gallop it down to meet the traveller.
He's a large wanderer coming to prove,
That sorrow and hiding is his station,
Throwaway work in his unraveller.
