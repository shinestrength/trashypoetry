Man! glorious soul, it's that time of year again
Ever the shopping trends, as if never the end
Relishing the goods people stretch to afford
Ravishing the season, and heralds and joy
Yet one lowly signal decrees the event;

Creation of Trash!
Huge piles that stick up!
Ravioli Renderings of gifts filled with pugs!
Igloos and Icicles appear out of season, and
Stalinesque Santas glowing with treason!
Trashiest Trash! I love this sequence,
Malaria's pileups cannot reinvent,
A kraken-nutcrackingly monstrous portent
Some Silveresque Sacks, of the Garbage Moment.
