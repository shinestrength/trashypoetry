Oh Bin! You glorious moulded receptacle 
You, hidden carrier of burden, of things quite upsetting 
The unassuming spectacle
of long rows of you weekly resetting
Praise freshly deserved for your steadfastness
The marvellous design and ease of mobility
And the great space inside you is easily vastness
Removing our waste leads to tranquility.

Bin, never be stolen! 
I'm in awe of your presence.

Nature's whim cannot upturn you
The council's good guidance needs no coup,
From upturned to downturned the same truth is found
Unlittered apartments are your glory unbound.

Oh Bin!
