There was and is only a single piece of
Hard off plastic in the bottom of my bin
It's a leftover blue and white liner
that protects against bits of
milk and meat, bones
casual causal spills
that fall from holes
into it's base
before I transfer 
it
to
the main one
the one on the outside.

this double bag theory,
It stays there every week since three or four or six weeks ago

The lining looks new 
and it's staying there
composition hardy undetermined, hardly 
and yet one day I know I'll have to replace it

that day is floe, sir coming.

Close wall close and thin
Replaced if never, an atta lablast soda tent-
brick to the sides
steeled off in pain
then be thrown.
